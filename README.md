# gosaster

Portable, language-agnostic SAST code scanner. 

Gosaster is a simple package to find potentially dangerous functions in source code that might lead to RCE. It works well in CTF-like assessments. 

## How to use

Just `curl` or `wget` the binary. Then run it by passing the directory you'd like to scan:

`./gosaster /my_vulnerable_project`
